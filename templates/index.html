    <h2>Welcome to UK Gov Comms</h2>
    <p>This site was created by volunteers from across the public and civic sectors. If you would like to contribute, potentially anonymously, get in touch by <a href="mailto:dave@bowsy.co.uk">emailing us</a>.</p>
    <p>It has 4 purposes.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To highlight the chilling effects of the recent unpublished government guidance to civil servants to "not speak at sector facing events with a Q&A" as referenced in a letter to the Times published on 14/7/25 and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/drhannahwhite.bsky.social/post/3ltvmpr2y2s2h">detailed here</a>.
      <li>To highlight instances of exemplary non-press office communication - see our <a href="/bestpractice">best practice page</a>.
      <li>As a response to the reduction in frequency of UK government communications not issued via press offices - see our <a href="/datavis">data visualisation page</a>.
      <li>To provide a set of government communication <b>principles</b> that any person or organisation can become a signatory to. 
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Government Communication Principles</h2>
    <p>The signatories on this website support the following principles.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Default to openness.</b>Unless there’s a good reason not to, share your work in the open. Openness builds trust, prevents duplication, and helps others learn from your successes (and mistakes).
      <li><b>Empower teams to speak.</b>Trust the people doing the work to talk about it. Let teams decide what to share, when to share it, and where to share it — without requiring central approval or sign-off.
      <li><b>Communicate early, improve continuously.</b>Share progress from the start. Invite feedback and input while there's still time to act on it. Use communication as a tool for collaboration, not just reporting.  
      <li><b>Choose healthy platforms.</b>Publish on platforms that support civil discourse, respect user rights, and aren't hostile to marginalised communities. Avoid spaces that reward outrage or amplify misinformation.
      <li><b>Write for everyone.</b>Use plain English. Be clear, honest, and inclusive. Aim to be understood by the people your work affects — not just your peers or specialists.
      <li><b>Use video to build trust.</b>Let people see and hear from the real humans doing the work as well as cheap-to-produce motion graphics. Video helps explain complex things simply, and builds confidence in the people behind public services.
      <li><b>Don’t chase the algorithm.</b>Optimise for usefulness, not reach. Engagement numbers mean little if the right people aren't being informed or helped.
      <li><b>Own your mistakes.</b>If something goes wrong, say so. Share what happened, what you're doing about it, and what you've learned. People respect honesty more than perfection.
      <li><b>Make it easy to get involved.</b>Every post should help people do something: give feedback, join in, ask a question, try a prototype, share an idea, or just say hello.
    </ul>
