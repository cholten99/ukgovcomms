    <h1>TBD page!</h1>

<pre>
Main page:
  * https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/comment/government-ban-public-servants-speaking-public
  * Work out what to do with the existing short and long docs
	* https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/building-review-apps-how-govuk-forms-improved-feedback-kelvin-gan-ris4e (because on LinkedIn)
	* Principles
		* Post in healthy spaces (Bluesky not Twitter)
		* Post often
		* Delegate trust
		* Surface the process - individual and aggrigate (see PlatformLand)
		* Solicit and share feedback
		* Video
		* Transparency standards as part of the Service Standard
	* Sign form (just emails me)
	* Should this include standard press releases or just mention / link to that / those RSS(s) and explain how this is different?
	* https://workspace.google.com/products/vids for animatic videos?
	* https://bsky.app/profile/jukes.ie/post/3lsizodvh3c24
	* https://www.linkedin.com/posts/policy-lab-uk_civilservice-ukcivilservice-government-activity-7343930321999921153-SQ4Z/
	
Best practice
	* GDS / DSIT newsletters
	* RSS feed on main page
	* Toggle types - blogs, newsletters(?), podcasts and video for now
	* When use admin page to add something automatically post it on the Bluesky account!
	* https://www.gov.uk/algorithmic-transparency-records/hmrc-ask-hmrc-online
	* https://enablingdigitalidentity.blog.gov.uk/2025/06/26/sharing-the-final-gamma-0-4-trust-framework-and-updated-supplementary-codes/
	* Go through all my RSS feeds obviously
