    <h1>TBD page!</h1>

<pre>
Main page:
	* Work out what to do with the existing short and long docs
	* https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/building-review-apps-how-govuk-forms-improved-feedback-kelvin-gan-ris4e (because on LinkedIn)
	* Principles
		* Post in healthy spaces (Bluesky not Twitter)
		* Post often
		* Delegate trust
		* Surface the process - individual and aggrigate (see PlatformLand)
		* Solicit and share feedback
		* Video
		* Transparency standards as part of the Service Standard
	* Sign form (just emails me)
	
Best practice
	* GDS / DSIT newsletters
	* MHCLG
	* RSS feed!
	* What else?

Video page
	* Link to old GDS videos
